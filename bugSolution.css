The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and avoiding the overreliance of `!important`:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.grandchild {
  color: green;
}

.parent .child .grandchild {
  color: purple; /*This is a solution. More specific selector wins*/
}

/*Instead of using !important, adjust specificity in the stylesheet to ensure correct precedence.
   In this case, more specific selector overrides the less specific selector. */

```

By clearly defining the styles based on specificity, without the need for `!important`, we create a maintainable and predictable CSS structure.  Adjusting the specificity of the selectors ensures that the correct styles are applied in the expected order.
